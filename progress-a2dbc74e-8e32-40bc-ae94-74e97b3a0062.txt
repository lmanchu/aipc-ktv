## Completed Stories

### ✅ Story 3.0: Database Schema Setup - Queue and Playlist Models
**Branch**: feature/week-1-4-implementation  
**Commit**: 19e3542

**Implementation**:
- Defined TypeScript interfaces in `src/shared/types.ts`:
  - Song interface with videoId, title, channel, thumbnail, duration fields
  - Queue interface with currentSong, upcomingSongs array, playbackState
  - Playlist interface with id, name, songs array, createdAt timestamp
  - PlaybackState enum with IDLE, PLAYING, PAUSED, LOADING, ERROR states

- Implemented Zustand stores:
  - **Queue Store** (`src/renderer/store/queueStore.ts`):
    * State: currentSong, upcomingSongs[], playbackState
    * Actions: addSong, removeSong, nextSong, clearQueue, reorderQueue, setPlaybackState, playQueue, playNext, setCurrentSong, shuffleQueue, moveInQueue
  - **Playlist Store** (`src/renderer/store/playlistStore.ts`):
    * State: playlists[]
    * Actions: createPlaylist, deletePlaylist, addSongToPlaylist, removeSongFromPlaylist, loadPlaylistToQueue, updatePlaylistName, renamePlaylist, moveSongInPlaylist, getPlaylist, clearPlaylist
    * Includes persist middleware for localStorage

- Re-export system via `src/renderer/types/index.ts` and `src/renderer/store/index.ts`

**Testing**:
- All existing tests pass (117/117) ✅
- Queue and playlist data models fully tested
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Build process successful

**Codebase Patterns**:
- Zustand stores with devtools middleware for debugging
- Persist middleware for playlists (localStorage)
- Action-based store pattern with typed interfaces
- Re-export pattern for clean imports
- Enum-based state management for PlaybackState
- Helper functions (generateId) at module level

- Story 5.0: Dual-Screen Window Management

## Build Status:
- ✅ TypeCheck: Passes
- ✅ Build: Successful  
- ✅ Tests: 117/117 passing
- ⚠️  Note: Zustand persist warnings in tests (expected, no localStorage in test environment)
